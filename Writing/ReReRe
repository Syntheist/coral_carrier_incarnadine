Reduce - reuse - recycle ideas


Reduce - items have less burden, increments of 2% up to a 50% reduction

Reuse - Processes and physical stations for storage, cleaning, refilling

Recycle - Mainly up-cycle of waste from world. Some onboard recycling.

Philosophy Leave a positive trace
Increased biodiversity
Reduce historic pollution
Recover, reuse or recycle waste

Mechanic ideas:

Skills to learn for benefits :

life-cycle analysis = reduce burden created by game actions
cradle to cradle = fully remove burden from reusable objects
microbiome herder = increase the efficiency of biological waste digestion
pearling = creation of Bad Pearls

Skills learned through music/sound skill tasks = tap grid pad to beat, tune two oscillators through encoders or grid, play melody as shown on grid

Water:
Reed beds, algae, many levels and layers of filtration.

Algae Infusions to digest plastic, oil, radioactive material

Bacterial filtration and digestion of waste to produce elements that are of use: oxygen, water, nitrogen

Some % of burden can only be processed with a ‘long rest’ style mechanic, that has costs in terms of other game actions or requires physical action as above or perhaps need to record 3 minutes of audio to tape.

Some % or types of burden cannot be processed at sea: toxic, radioactive, pathogenic = deadweight

Deadweight is more likely to come from high value wrecks or other human artefact salvage.

Each unit of deadweight reduces hope by 0.1% each ‘turn’

Deadweight processing - encase in glass spheres (Bad Pearls)

Bad Pearls each reduce hope by 0.01%

Bad pearls can only be processed on land (New Orleans Re-purposing Facility)

“Captain we must head NORF soon, Bad Pearl storage approaching capacity.”
